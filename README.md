This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked bug in JavaScript: event listeners failing to attach to dynamically created elements. The `bug.html` file showcases the issue, where a click event listener is added to a div element after it is created. The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version. This bug can be tricky to diagnose, as it seems like the listener should work, but it doesn't, resulting in unexpected behavior.
